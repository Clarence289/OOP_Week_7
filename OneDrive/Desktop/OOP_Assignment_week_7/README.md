# OOP Assignment Week 7

This repository contains Python examples for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including class design, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Files

- `book_example.py`: Demonstrates a `Book` class and an `EBook` subclass, showing attributes, methods, constructors, inheritance, and method overriding.
- `vehicle_polymorphism.py`: Demonstrates polymorphism with a `Vehicle` base class and subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) that override the `move()` method.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the scripts using:
   ```bash
   python book_example.py
   python vehicle_polymorphism.py
   ```
